My name is Maya Luire, and I am a sophmore biomedical engineering major. I have two major passions that blend together well under my major. My first passion being my love for math and science and my seconf passion being helping people with disabilities. I have very personal connections to my second passion, which also relates more with what I want my future career to be, making medical devices for people with a range of abilities. On campus I am involved in an engineering project team, Engineering World Health, and I am a part of SWE. Outside of academics I am involved in the greek organization Sigma Delta Tau. Outisde of school I enjoy spending time with my family and friends and love to travel.
